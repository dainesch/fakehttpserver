200.key=200 OK
200.desc=Standard response for successful HTTP requests. The actual response will depend on the request method used. In a GET request, the response will contain an entity corresponding to the requested resource. In a POST request, the response will contain an entity describing or containing the result of the action.

204.key=204 No Content
204.desc=The server successfully processed the request, but is not returning any content.

301.key=301 Moved Permanently
301.desc=This and all future requests should be directed to the given URI.

302.key=302 Found
302.desc=This is an example of industry practice contradicting the standard. The HTTP/1.0 specification (RFC 1945) required the client to perform a temporary redirect (the original describing phrase was "Moved Temporarily"),[24] but popular browsers implemented 302 with the functionality of a 303 See Other. Therefore, HTTP/1.1 added status codes 303 and 307 to distinguish between the two behaviours.[25] However, some Web applications and frameworks use the 302 status code as if it were the 303.

303.key=303 See Other
303.desc=The response to the request can be found under another URI using a GET method. When received in response to a POST (or PUT/DELETE), it should be assumed that the server has received the data and the redirect should be issued with a separate GET message.

400.key=400 Bad Request
400.desc=The server cannot or will not process the request due to something that is perceived to be a client error (e.g., malformed request syntax, invalid request message framing, or deceptive request routing).

401.key=401 Unauthorized
401.desc=Similar to 403 Forbidden, but specifically for use when authentication is required and has failed or has not yet been provided. The response must include a WWW-Authenticate header field containing a challenge applicable to the requested resource. See Basic access authentication and Digest access authentication.

403.key=403 Forbidden
403.desc=The request was a valid request, but the server is refusing to respond to it. Unlike a 401 Unauthorized response, authenticating will make no difference.

404.key=404 Not Found
404.desc=The requested resource could not be found but may be available again in the future. Subsequent requests by the client are permissible.

500.key=500 Internal Server Error
500.desc=A generic error message, given when an unexpected condition was encountered and no more specific message is suitable.
